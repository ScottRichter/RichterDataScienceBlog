# RichterDataScienceBlog
 My personal data science blog
 
 The blog began with my capstone project for an MS in Data Science, in which I modeled readability scores for CommonLit, a literacy NPO.  
 This is where I'll post about my hobby projects and analyses.
 
 Visit me at [my blog](https://richterdatascience.netlify.app/) to see what I'm up to!
